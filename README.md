### ðŸ“Š Table Structure: `Retail`

```sql
customer_id INT,
sale_date DATE,

```

### 10. Find customers who made purchases in more than one month

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT month) AS months_active
FROM Retail
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month) > 1;
```

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level

### 11. Calculate total sales by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)

```sql
SELECT timeofday, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM Retail
GROUP BY timeofday;
```

### 12. Find top 3 customers with highest total sales

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_spent
FROM Retail
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 13. Monthly sales trend for each category

```sql
SELECT category, month, SUM(total_sale) AS monthly_sales
FROM Retail
GROUP BY category, month
ORDER BY category, month;
```

### 14. Find the average age of customers buying each category

```sql
SELECT category, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM Retail
GROUP BY category;
```

### 15. Get sales data only for weekends

```sql
SELECT * FROM Retail
WHERE name_day IN ('Saturday', 'Sunday');
```
### 16.Find the total revenue  generated by each product in the last 2 years.

```sql
SELECT year SUM(total_sale) AS total
FROM retail
WHERE sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 year';
Note: it will work only sql server
         (or)
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year_total,
       SUM(total_sale) AS total
FROM retail
WHERE sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 years'
GROUP BY year_total;
Note: it will work in postgres
### 16.Find the total revenue  generated by each product in the last 2 years.

       SUM(total_sale) AS total
FROM retail
WHERE sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 years'
GROUP BY year_total;


### 17.How many orders were placed on each weekday, and which weekday had the highest number of orders
